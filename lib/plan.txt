Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task:

### Plan:
1. **Review the `board.dart` file**:
   - Ensure that the `dropPiece` method is correctly called when the "Drop" button is pressed.
   - Verify that the game board updates correctly when a piece is dropped.

2. **Review the `piece.dart` file**:
   - Confirm that the `dropPiece` method functions as intended, allowing the piece to drop until it collides with another piece or the bottom of the board.
   - Ensure that the position validation methods (`positionIsValid` and `piecePositionIsValid`) are functioning correctly.

3. **Testing**:
   - After making any necessary adjustments, test the game to ensure that pieces drop correctly and that the game logic works as expected.

4. **Final Review**:
   - Check for any additional issues or improvements that can be made to enhance gameplay.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Implement any changes needed based on the review.
- Test the game thoroughly to ensure all functionalities are working correctly.
